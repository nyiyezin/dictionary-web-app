## My Process

### Built With

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that significantly speeds up the development process.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A powerful state management library for managing application state in React applications.
- **Styled Components**: A CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write plain CSS in your JavaScript to style React components dynamically.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for adding smooth animations and interactive motion effects to web applications.

### What I Learned

I have become more comfortable using React Redux Toolkit (RTK), Framer Motion and styled components. My most proudest moment in doing this project is I was able to found a way to persist changes between session using redux-resist. I still struggle a bit with thinking about the logic before writing the actual implementation.

### Continued Development

I aim to try out Cypress testing using this project.
